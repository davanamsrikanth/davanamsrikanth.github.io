  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Based in Hyderabad, India, Davanam Srikanth works at the intersection of public administration, indirect taxation, and governance.
He is associated with Customs and GST administration and writes from a practitioner’s perspective on how public institutions function on the ground — covering areas such as revenue protection, regulatory compliance, and career pathways in the public sector.
His writing is primarily aimed at students, competitive exam aspirants, and readers interested in understanding the practical side of governance beyond textbooks.
